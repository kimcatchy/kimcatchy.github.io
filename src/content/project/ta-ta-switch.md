A lightweight, high-performance account manager for "Arknights: Endfield (Global)". This tool is designed to switch between multiple accounts with a single click by swapping locally stored session cache files, with a minimal memory footprint (< 10MB) and zero background CPU usage.


⚠️ **Note: This tool is compatible with "Arknights: Endfield" installed via the** [**Native Launcher**](https://endfield.gryphline.com/) **and the Epic Games Store. Installations via Google Play Games are currently not supported.**


## ✨ Features

- **Profile Swapping**: Instantly switch between multiple accounts by replacing session files.
- **Memory Efficient & Native UI**: Uses native Windows Win32 API for menus and dialogs, optimized to stay under 10MB of RAM.
- **Auto Detection**: Automatically finds your game installation and session folders. (Native Launcher prioritized)
- **Secure Backups**: Keeps account session data safe in independent storage.
- **Admin Elevation**: Automatically requests administrator privileges to modify session files.
- **Localized**: Full support for English and Korean.

## 📂 Data Storage & Backups


Settings and backup data are stored in the user's **Documents** folder instead of the executable's directory. This ensures your data remains safe even if you move or delete the executable.

- **Path**: `%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\TA-TA\\switch`
- **Contents**:
    - `settings.ini`: App configuration and language preferences.
    - `backups/`: Folder containing independent session data for each account.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Launch**: Run `TA-TA-Switch.exe`.
2. **Auto Detect**: Click the tray icon and select **Auto Detect Paths**. Prioritizes installations via the native launcher; if not found, checks for the Epic Games Store path.
3. **Save Session**: Log in to an account in-game, then select **Save Current Session** from the tray to name and save that profile.
4. **Switch**: Close the game and select a profile from the **Select Profile** menu.
5. **Launch Game**: Click **Launch Endfield** to start the game with the selected profile.
